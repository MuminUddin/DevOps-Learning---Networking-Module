## âœ… Steps Completed:

### 1. Domain Registration
- Registered `muminlabs.com` via AWS Route 53
- Disabled auto-renewal (as this is for learning purposes)

### 2. EC2 Instance Setup
- Launched an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2023
- Created a new key pair for secure SSH access (`muminlabs-key.pem`)
- Configured security group to allow:
  - SSH (port 22) from my IP

### 3. Connected via SSH
```bash
ssh -i "muminlabs-key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip>
